The term's other major [glossary](../../academics/ms797-glossary/), for [MS797, Machine Learning for Social Science](../../academics/ms797), is up. At this point it's about halfway through chapter 3... lots to go. This was initially in a standalone repo, but I think it makes more sense to migrate it here.

Again, comments, clarifications or corrections are all welcome.
