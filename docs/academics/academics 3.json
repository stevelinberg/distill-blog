Non-page numbers indicate other sources; “biostats” references material from Biostatistics 690Z (Health Data Science: Statistical Modeling), fall 2021.\nChapter 2\ninput variable (15)\nalso predictor, independent variable, feature; usually written \\(X_1, X_2\\), etc. The parameter or parameters we are testing to see if they are related to or affect the output.\n\noutput variable (15)\nalso response, dependent variable; usually written \\(Y\\). The outcome being measured.\n\nerror term (16)\n\\(\\epsilon\\) in the equation\\[Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\] a random quantity of inaccuracy, independent of X and with mean 0.\n\nsystematic (16)\n\\(f\\) in the equation\\[Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\] the function that describes the (systematic) information \\(X\\) provides about \\(Y\\). This plus the error term equals \\(Y\\).\n\nreducible error (18)\nThe amount of the error \\(\\epsilon\\) that could be eliminated by improving our estimator \\(\\hat{f}\\); the difference between \\(\\hat{f}\\) and \\(f\\). This book and course is mostly about ways to minimize the reducible error.\n\nirreducible error (18)\nThe amount of \\(\\epsilon\\) that could not be reduced even if \\(f\\) was a perfect estimator of \\(Y\\). Always greater than 0. Could be due to hidden variables in \\(\\epsilon\\), or random fluctuations in Y, like a measure of “[a] patient’s general feeling of well-being on that day”.\n\nexpected value (19)\naverage value of an expected measure.\n\ntraining data (21)\ndata used to develop the model for estimating \\(f\\).\n\nparametric methods (21)\nA model based on one or more input parameters, that yields a value for Y, as in: \\[f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p\\] \\[Y \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p\\] \\[\\text{income} \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{education} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{seniority}\\] This creates a predictive, inflexible model which usually does not match the true \\(f\\), but which has advantages of simplicity and interpretability. It can be used to predict values for \\(Y\\) based on its parameters, or inputs. Linear and logistic regression are parametric.\n\nnon-parametric methods (23)\nmethods that do not attempt to estimate \\(f\\). More flexible and have the potential to very closely match observations, but with the risk of overfitting the data and increasing the variance of subsequent observations. They require much more data than parametric models, and may be difficult to interpret, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines are non-parametric.\n\nprediction (26)\nseeking to guess the value of an response variable \\(y_i\\) given a set of observations and a predictor \\(f\\).\n\ninference (26)\na model that seems to better understand the relationship between the response and the predictors.\n\nsupervised learning (26)\na category of model that allows us to guess a \\(y_i\\) response to a set of predictor measurements \\(x_i, i = 1, \\dots, n\\).\n\nunsupervised learning (26)\na category of model in which there are observations/measurements \\(x_i, i = 1, \\dots, n\\), but no associated response \\(y_i\\). Linear regression cannot be used because there is no response variable to predict.\n\ncluster analysis (27)\nin unsupervised learning, a statistical method for determining whether a set of observations can be divided into “relatively distinct groups,” looking for similarities within the groups. (Topic modeling may be an example of this.)\n\nquantitative variables (28)\nnumeric values; age, height, weight, quantity. Usually the response variable type for regression problems.\n\nqualitative variables (28)\nalso categorical: values from a discrete set. Eye color, name, yes/no. Usually the response variable type for classification problems.\n\nregression problems (28)\nproblems with quantitative response variables. Given predictors foo, bar, and baz, how big is the frob?\n\nclassification problems (28)\nproblems with qualitative response variables. Given predictors foo, bar, and baz, is the outcome likely to be a frob, a frib or a freeb?\n\nmean squared error (MSE) (29)\nthe average squared error for a set of observations: \\[MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i))^2\\] MSE is small if the predicted responses are close to the true responses, and larger as it becomes less accurate; computed from training data, and Gareth et al. suggest it should be called training MSE.\n\nvariance (34)\n“the amount by which \\(\\hat{f}\\) would change if we estimated it using a different training data set”\n\nbias (35)\n“the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model”, as in the error from the (presumed) linearity of a regression against non-linear data whose complexity it does not capture. More flexible models increase variance and decrease bias.\n\nbias-variance trade-off (36)\nThe tension in seeking the best model for the data between missing the true \\(f\\) with an overly simple (biased) model, vs. an overfitted model with too much variance from mapping too closely to test data.\n\nerror rate (37)\nIn classification, the proportion of classifications that are mistakes. \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i)\\] \\(I\\) is 1 if \\(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i\\) - if the guess for any given \\(y\\) is wrong. The error rate is the percentage of incorrect classifications. Also the training erorr rate.\n\nindicator variable (37)\n\\(I\\) in the error rate definition above; a logical variable indicating the presence or absence of a characteristic or trait (such as an accurate classification).\n\ntest error rate (37)\nlike the training error rate but applied to the test data. Uses \\(\\text{Ave}\\) instead of sum notation: \\[\\text{Ave}(I(y_0 \\neq \\hat{y}_0))\\] \\(\\hat{y}_0\\) is the predicted class label from the classifier.\n\nconditional probability (37)\nThe chance that \\(Y = j\\) given an observed \\(x_0\\), as in the Bayes classifier: \\[\\text{Pr}(Y = j|X = x_0)\\] In a two-class, yes/no classifier, we decide based on whether \\(\\text{Pr}(Y = j|X = x_0)\\) is \\(> 0.5\\), or not. Note that \\(Y\\) is the class, as in “ham”/“spam”, not a \\(y\\)-axis coordinate.\n\nBayes decision boundary (38)\na visual depiction of the line of 50% probability dividing (exactly two?) classes in a two-dimensional space\n\nBayes error rate (38)\nthe expected (average) probability of classification error over all values of X in a data set. \\[1 - E(\\underset{j}{maxPr}(Y = j|X))\\] The \\(\\underset{j}{maxPr}\\) whichever of the \\(j\\) classes has the highest probability for any given value of \\(X\\). Again, \\(Y\\) is not a y-axis coordinate of a two-dimensional space, it’s the class of the classification: “yes”/“no”, “ham”/“spam”, “infected”/“not infected”. Also: “The Bayes error rate is analogous to the irreducible error, discussed earlier.”\n\nK-nearest-neighbors (KNN) (39)\na classifier that assigns a class Y to an observation based on the population proportions of its nearest neighbors; a circular “neighborhood” on a two-dimensional plot. It looks at actual data points that have been classified, and asks what any given non-classified point would be classified as based on its nearest neighbors.\n\nChapter 3\nSynergy effect / interaction effect (60)\nwhen two or more predictors affect each other as well as the outcome; when 50k each in TV or radio ads give different results than 100k in either one\n\nSimple linear regression\nthe simplest model, predicting \\(Y\\) from a single predictor \\(X\\). \\[Y \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\\] \\(\\approx\\) = “is approximately modeled as”\n\nleast squares (61)\nthe most common measure of closeness of a regression line to its data points, the sum of squares of the distances between the points and the closest point on the line (directly above or below)\n\nresidual (61)\nthe difference between \\(y_i\\) and \\(\\hat{y}_i\\), also \\(e_i\\); the difference between the \\(i\\)th response variable and the \\(i\\)th response variable predicted by the model\n\nresidual sum of squares (RSS) (62)\nthe sum of the squared residuals for each point on the regression line \\[\\text{RSS} = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_n^2\\] Formulas for \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) are on p. 62\n\nintercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) (63)\nthe expected value of \\(Y\\) when \\(X = 0\\)\n\nslope (\\(\\beta_1\\)) (63)\nthe average increase in \\(Y\\) associated with a one-unit increase in \\(X\\)\n\nerror term (\\(\\epsilon\\)) (63)\nwhatever we missed with the model, due to the true model not being linear (it almost never is), measurement error, or other variables that cause variation in \\(Y\\)\n\npopulation regression line (63)\n“the best linear approximation to the true relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)” \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\epsilon\\] least squares line (63)\n\nthe regression line made of the least-squares estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\)\n\nbias (65)\nin an estimator, something that systematically misses the true parameter; for an unbiased estimator, \\(\\hat{\\mu} = \\mu\\) when averaged over (huge) numbers of observations\n\nstandard error (SE) (65)\nthe average amount that an estimate \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) (sample mean) differs from the actual value of \\(\\mu\\) (population mean) \\[\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu})^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} (\\text{also} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})\\] \\(\\sigma\\) is “the standard deviation of each of the realizations \\(y_i\\) of \\(Y\\). Since \\(\\sigma^2\\) is divided by \\(n\\), the standard error shrinks as observations increase. It represents the amount we would expect means of additional samples to”jump around\" simply due to random chance and the limitations of the model’s accuracy.1\n\nresidual standard error (RSE) (66)\nthe estimate of \\(\\sigma\\) \\[\\text{RSE} = \\sqrt{RSS / (n-2)}\\]\n\nconfidence interval (66)\na range of values within which we have a measured probability (often 95%) of containing the true value of the parameter; a 95% confidence interval in linear regression takes the form \\[\\hat{\\beta_1} \\pm 2 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\]\n\nt-statistic (67)\nthe number of standard deviations that \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) is away from \\(0\\). \\[t = \\frac{{\\hat{\\beta_1}} - 0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})}\\] For there to be a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) has to be nonzero (i.e. have a slope). The standard error (SE) of \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) (in the denominator above) measures its accuracy; if it is small, then \\(t\\) will be larger, and if it is large, then \\(t\\) will be smaller. \\(t\\) is around 2 for a p-value of 0.05 (actually about 1.96, as 2 standard deviations is 95.45% of a normal distribution), and around 2.75 for a p-value of 0.01.\n\np-value (67)\nthe probability of observing a value greater than \\(|t|\\) by chance.\n\nmodel sum of squares (MSS) (biostats)\nAlso sometimes ESS, “explained sum of squares”: the total variance in the response \\(Y\\) that can be accounted for by the model \\[\\text{MSS} = \\sum(\\hat{y_i} - \\bar{y})^2\\]\n\nresidual sum of squares (RSS) (biostats)\nthe total variance in the response \\(Y\\) that cannot be accounted for by the model \\[\\text{RSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\\] also \\[\\text{RSS} = e_i^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_n^2\\] or \\[\\text{RSS} = (y_1 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - {\\hat{\\beta_1}x_1})^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - {\\hat{\\beta_1}x_2})^ + \\dots + (y_n - \\hat{\\beta_0} - {\\hat{\\beta_1}x_n})^2\\]\n\ntotal sum of squares (TSS) (70)\nthe total variance in the response \\(Y\\); the total variability of the response about its mean \\[\\text{TSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\] compare with RSS, the amount of variability left unexplained after the regression. TSS - RSS is the amount of variability (or error) explained by the regression (MSS).\n\nNOTE: there is a nice visual here on stackexchange; if anybody knows how to tell Zotero to use a custom bibtex citation entry over the ones it generates, please let me know so I can integrate it better here :frown:\n\\(R^2\\) statistic (70)\nthe proportion of variance in \\(Y\\) explained by \\(X\\), a range from 0 to 1 \\[R^2 = \\frac{\\text{TSS - RSS}}{\\text{TSS}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}}\\] \\(R^2\\) values close to 1 indicate a regression that explains a lot of the variability in the response, and a stronger model. A value close to 0 indicates that the regression doesn’t explain much of the variability.\n\ncorrelation (70)\na measure of the linearity of the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\); values close to 0 indicate weak-to-no relationship, values near 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative correlation (horrible formula on p.70 I don’t have time to LaTeX at the moment)\n\nstandard linear regression model (72)\nThe modal used for standard linear models, used to interpret the the effect on \\(Y\\) of a one-unit increase in any predictor \\(\\beta_j\\) while holding all other predictors constant \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p + \\epsilon\\]\n\nvariable selection (78)\nthe task of refining a model to include only the variables associated with the response\n\nnull model (79)\na model that conatins an intercept, but no predictors; used as a first stage in forward selection\n\nforward selection (79)\na variable selection method that starts with a null model, and then runs simple linear regressions on all predictors \\(p\\) and adding the one that results in the lowest RSS; repeated until some threshold is reached\n\nbackwards selection (79)\na variable selection method that starts with a model with all predictors, and removing the one with the lowest \\(p\\)-value until all remaining predictors are significant, whether by \\(p\\)-value or some other criterion\n\nmixed selection (79)\na hybrid approach starting with a null model, adding predictors one at a time that produce the best fit, and removing any that acquire a larger \\(p\\)-value in the process until all predictors are added or eliminated\n\ninteraction (81)\nwhen predictors affect each other, in addition to providing their own effect on the model\n\nconfidence interval (82)\na range with a percentage component in which there is that percentage chance that the true value of an estimated parameter lies; a 95% confidence interval is a range in which we can be 95% certain \\(f(X)\\) will be found\n\nprediction interval (82)\nsimilar to confidence interval, but a prediction range within which we are \\(X\\)% certain that any singular future observation will fall, rather than a statistic like an overall mean; a 95% prediction interval is a range in which we are confident that 95% of future observations will fall. Prediction ranges are substantially wider than confidence intervals.\n\nqualitative predictor / factor (83)\na categorical predictor with a fixed number of factors, like “yes” / “no” or “red” / “yellow” / “green”\n\ndummy variable (83)\na numeric representation of a factor to use in a model, as in representing “yes” / “no” factor variables as 1 / 0 in a regression\n\nbaseline (86)\nthe factor level where there is no dummy variable; a factor with 3 levels will use 2 dummy variables, with the factor’s absence signifying the 3rd value (usually 0)\n\nadditivity assumption (87)\nthe assumption that the association between a predictor \\(X\\) and the response \\(Y\\) does not depend on the value of other predictors; used by the standard linear regression model\n\nlinearity assumption (87)\nthe assumption, also used by the standard linear regression model, that unit changes in \\(X_j\\) result in the same change to Y regardless of its value\n\ninteraction term (88)\nthe product of two predictors in a multiple regression model, quantifying their effect on each other\n\nmain effect (89)\nisolated effects; the effect of a single predictor on the outcome\n\nhierarchical principle (89)\nthe principle that main effects should be left in a model even if they are statistically insignificant, if they are also part of an interaction that is significant\n\npolynomial regression (91)\nan extension of linear regression to accommodate non-linear relationships\n\nresidual plot (93)\na plot of the residuals or errors (\\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\)), used to check for non-linearity (a potential problem that would likely indicate something was missed in the model)\n\ntime series (94)\ndata consisting of observation made at discrete points in time\n\ntracking (95)\nwhen (residuals / variables?) tend to have similar values\n\nheteroscedasticity (96)\nnon-constant variances in errors; “unequal scatter”\n\nhomoscedasticity (extra)\nconstant variances in errors; follows the assumption of equal variance required by most methods\n\nweighted least squares (97)\nan extension to ordinary least squares used in circumstances of heteroscedasticity, to weight data points proportionally with the inverse variances\n\noutlier (97)\nan observation whose value is very far from its predicted value\n\nstudentized residual (98)\na residual divided by its estimated standard error; observations with student errors higher than 3 (indicating 3 standard deviations) are likely outliers\n\nhigh leverage (98)\nobservations with an unusual \\(x_i\\) value, far from other / expected \\(x\\) values\n\nleverage statistic (99)\na quantification of a point’s leverage \\[h_i = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{i'=1}^{n}(x_{i`} - \\bar{x})^2}\\]\n\ncollinearity (99)\nwhen two or more predictor variables are closely related to each other\n\npower (101)\nthe probability of a test correctly detecting a nonzero coefficient (and correctly rejecting \\(H_0 : \\beta_j = 0\\))\n\nmulticollinearity (102)\nwhen collinearity exists between three or more predictors even when no pair of predictors is collinear (or correlated)\n\nvariance inflation factor (102)\n“the ratio of the variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) when fitting the full model divided by the variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) on its own”; smallest possible value of 1 indicates the absence of collinearity, 5-10 indicates a “problematic amount”.
