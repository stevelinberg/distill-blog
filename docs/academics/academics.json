Padgett, representing intermarriages between prominent families in Florence between 1282 and 1500. This is an area of interest to me as I have some background in fine art, and the Medici family in particular was known for its patronage of some of history’s greatest artists throughout the Renaissance, including Boticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo. No less than Galileo Galilei himself tutored several generations of Medici children.\nThe great families of this era were frequently fierce rivals, with delicately balanced power structures measured in various spheres of influence; intermarriages were one way that alliances were forged between families in the ceaseless effort to gain political or financial advantage over their competitors.\nThe Medici family was the most prominent in Florence throughout the renaissance. Two other prominent families, the Strozzi and Guadagni, also exercised considerable influence (they were all banking families), and did not intermarry with the Medici, though they were not far removed. This essay looks at the marriage network between the various families as one measure of social power and centrality in Renaissance Florence.\nThe flo dataset in the R network library is an adjacency matrix of 16 families of this era, including the aforementioned. It contains the 16 nodes of the families, and 20 unweighted, directed edges between them. The Pucci family is an isolate, making the network disconnected; the remaining nodes form a single component.\nThe families in the dataset, with their total intermarriage count (degree), marriages into each family (indegrees) and marriages out to other families (outdegrees) are:\n\n             degree indegrees outdegrees\nAcciaiuoli        2         1          1\nAlbizzi           6         3          3\nBarbadori         4         2          2\nBischeri          6         3          3\nCastellani        6         3          3\nGinori            2         1          1\nGuadagni          8         4          4\nLamberteschi      2         1          1\nMedici           12         6          6\nPazzi             2         1          1\nPeruzzi           6         3          3\nPucci             0         0          0\nRidolfi           6         3          3\nSalviati          4         2          2\nStrozzi           8         4          4\nTornabuoni        6         3          3\n\nA visualization shows each marriage as a line connecting two families:\n\n\n\nEach node is sized according to its number of connections; it is easy to see from this diagram that the Medici family had the most marriages within the Florence family network, with six. The Strozzi and Guadagni families were next at four apiece.\nA component layout offers a different view that makes distances and paths easier to read:\n\n\n\nFrom this layout, we can see that the Medici, Strozzi and Guadagni never directly intermarried, but were also only separated from each other by one node. With an overall average path length of approximately 2.5, this suggests some calculus and deliberation: not directly joining with their main rivals, but remaining only one degree removed.\nThe overall network density is \\(\\approx\\) 0.16; 20 connections by marriage out of a possible total of 120. Four of the 16 nodes are pendants. We might expect the network density to increase if we looked at more families than the 16 listed here; it is very unlikely that only 16% of families experienced any marriages at all! This would need to be weighed against the prominence of the additional families according to the criteria with which this initial set was selected.\nIt would be interesting to me to look deeper into a bipartite network of connections between the families and who they patronized, especially the artists and scientists of the era. This would require more data than is present in this set, but could be very revealing about other ways in which the families interacted, competing for social and political influence in the dynamic period of the Renaissance.\n\n\n\n",

The igraph version also breaks them into the 16 categories, but returns them in a fixed order not detailed in its return value (described in its help documentation).\nThe total number of possible triads in a 298 vertex network is (298 x 297 x 296) / (3 x 2 x 1) - the 3 countdown comes from “triad”. Quads would be (298 x 297 x 296 x 295) / (4 x 3 x 2 x 1).\nTransitivity\nTransitivity is the percentage of potential connected triads - how many are complete. Basic way in igraph is transitivity(). The statnet version is gtrans(), but it only works in directed networks. print() will say whether the network is directed. (Note: in the tutorial, we see that the climate network IS directed, but it returns a different result than igraph: 0.627 vs 0.724. Not clear why. “it is calculating a transitivity score based on an understanding of network structure rooted in hierarchy”)\nLocal transitivity is the local clustering coefficient - how many nodes of an ego are connected to each other. Have to unpack this, but the magic is:\ntransitivity(gotbook.ig, type=\"local\", \n  vids=V(gotbook.ig)[\n  c(\"Petyr Baelish\",\"Jon Snow\", \"Tyrion Lannister\")]) \nThe global clustering coefficient in igraph is\ntransitivity(trade2007.ig, type=\"global\")\n[1] 0.8837142\nThe local coefficient is:\ntransitivity(trade2007.ig, type=\"average\")\n[1] 0.8862707\nNetwork transitivity in statnet is gtrans():\ngtrans(trade2007.stat)\n[1] 0.9993143\n\nigraph\nstatnet\nglobal clustering coefficient\ntransitivity(trade2007.ig,  type=\"global\")\ngtrans(trade2007.stat) (directed only)\nlocal clustering coefficient\ntransitivity(trade2007.ig,  type=\"local\")\n???\naverage local clustering coefficient\ntransitivity(trade2007.ig,  type=\"average\")\n???\nDegree\nigraph::degree() and statnet::degree(), and once again they give different results; igraph includes loops, statnet doesn’t. Force igraph to ignore them with loops = FALSE. “Note that setting diag=TRUE in sna::degree does not guarantee equivalence as statnet only single counts the loops in a directed network, while igraph double-counts the loops.”\nigraph shows the node names, statnet doesn’t.\nGetting the degree of a particular set of nodes in igraph:\nigraph::degree(trade2007.ig, v = V(trade2007.ig)[c(\"China\", \"Canada\", \"United Kingdom\", \"Denmark\")])\n         China         Canada United Kingdom        Denmark \n           364            364            364            362 \nIndegree and outdegree calculations\n\nigraph\nstatnet\nindegree\nigraph::degree(climate.ig,mode=\"in\", loops = FALSE)\nsna::degree(climate.stat, cmode=\"indegree\")\noutdegree\nigraph::degree(climate.ig,mode=\"out\", loops = FALSE)\nsna::degree(climate.stat, cmode=\"outdegree\")\nCode from the tutorial to create data.frames with degree statistics:\n#igraph:\n\ntrade2007.nodes <- data.frame(name = V(trade2007.ig)$name,\n    totdegree = igraph::degree(trade2007.ig, loops = FALSE),\n    indegree = igraph::degree(trade2007.ig, mode = \"in\", loops = FALSE),\n    outdegree = igraph::degree(trade2007.ig, mode = \"out\", loops = FALSE))\n\n#statnet version:\n\ntrade2007.nodes <- data.frame(name = trade2007.stat%v%\"vertex.names\",\n    totdegree = sna::degree(trade2007.stat),\n    indegree = sna::degree(trade2007.stat, cmode = \"indegree\"),\n    outdegree = sna::degree(trade2007.stat, cmode = \"outdegree\"))\nComponents\nShortest path length between 2 nodes: igraph distances() does this.\ndistances(gotbook.ig,\"Petyr Baelish\",\"Robb Stark\")\n# Calculate distance using unweighted edges\ndistances(gotbook.ig,\"Petyr Baelish\",\"Robb Stark\", weights=NA)\n# list shortest paths between 2 nodes\nall_shortest_paths(gotbook.ig,\"Bronn\",\"Varys\", weights=NA)$res\n#find average shortest path for network\naverage.path.length(gotbook.ig,directed=F)\nComponent structure and membership\n# What element are returned by components\nnames(igraph::components(gotbook.ig))\n\n# Number of components\nigraph::components(gotbook.ig)$no \n\n# Size of each component\nigraph::components(gotbook.ig)$csize \n\n# retrieve the index of isolate nodes\n# (nodes with component count of 1 from \"components\" above)\nisolates(gotbook.stat)\n\n# subset vertex.names attribute to get names of isolates\nas.vector(gotbook.stat %v% 'vertex.names')[c(isolates(gotbook.stat))]\nGraph density\nNote: network.density() (statnet) ignores edge values “at present”.\n#get network density: igraph\ngraph.density(climate.ig)\n\n## [1] 0.4117647\n\n#get network density: statnet\nnetwork.density(climate.stat)\n\n## [1] 0.399654\nAdding loops = TRUE to graph.density() appears to fix the problem and gets the two packages to agree:\n#get network density without loops: igraph\ngraph.density(climate.ig, loops=TRUE)\n\n## [1] 0.399654\nSO, it’s safest to always do either: - graph.density(climate.ig, loops=TRUE) (igraph), OR - network.density(climate.stat) (statnet)\nIn statnet, we can get network density with loops (nodes connecting to themselves) omitted:\n#get network density without loops: statnet\ngden(climate.stat, diag=FALSE)\n\n## [1] 0.3921569\nNetwork degree centralization\nIn statnet, call centralization() with the degree function and appropriate parameters for degree in the cmode argument:\ncentralization(climate.stat, degree, cmode=\"indegree\")\ncentralization(climate.stat, degree, cmode=\"outdegree\")\ncentralization(climate.stat, degree, cmode=\"freeman\") # default\nCould also call it with other sna functions like betweenness, closeness; tutorial references eigenvalue but there is no such function in sna. evcent perhaps?\nThe igraph version uses centr_degree() and returns an object with several components, of which centralization is one:\ncentr_degree(climate.ig, loops = FALSE, mode = \"in\")$centralization\ncentr_degree(climate.ig, loops = FALSE, mode = \"out\")$centralization\n\n\n\n",

The Lab section of each chapter contains useful walkthroughs and code illustrating the chapter’s key concepts, and there’s always something to learn about R and how different people use it.\n\nEverything here is, unless otherwise marked, either the work of, or derivative of the work of, the original authors of the book.\nChapter 3: Linear Regression\n\n\n\nnames(): see the attributes of a model\nnames() is a nice, simple way to see the attributes of a linear model:\n\n [1] \"coefficients\"  \"residuals\"     \"effects\"       \"rank\"         \n [5] \"fitted.values\" \"assign\"        \"qr\"            \"df.residual\"  \n [9] \"xlevels\"       \"call\"          \"terms\"         \"model\"        \n\ncoef(): see the model’s coefficients\ncoef() is a convenient way to get the coefficients attribute:\n\n(Intercept)       lstat \n 34.5538409  -0.9500494 \n\nNote: this is equivalent to lm.fit$coefficients, but slightly easier on the eyes.\nconfint(): see confidence intervals for a model\n\n                2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept) 33.448457 35.6592247\nlstat       -1.026148 -0.8739505\n\nNote: levels can be added with the level parameter (the default is 0.95):\n\n                  5 %       95 %\n(Intercept) 33.626697 35.4809847\nlstat       -1.013877 -0.8862212\n\npredict(): see confidence OR prediction intervals for a model\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 29.80359 29.00741 30.59978\n2 25.05335 24.47413 25.63256\n3 20.30310 19.73159 20.87461\n       fit       lwr      upr\n1 29.80359 17.565675 42.04151\n2 25.05335 12.827626 37.27907\n3 20.30310  8.077742 32.52846\n\nNote: prediction intervals are defined on p. 82; in brief, it is the interval in which we are \\(X\\)% certain that any future observation will fall.\nNote: the data.frame() call in the above parameter lists produce a nifty little data frame that is used by predict to identify the column to do calculations on, and the desired levels:\n\n  lstat\n1     5\n2    10\n3    15\n\nNote: the book uses the base R graphics:\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse/ggplot version of this is:\n\n\n\n…a bit more work, but more modern.\narranging plots in grids\nThe book uses base R, again, with par() and mfrow() to arrange plots:\n\n\n\nggplot uses facet() to arrange plots from the same data set in grids.\nPlots from different data sets need additional packages to be combined; one option is the cowplot library and the plot_grid() function.\nEVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE\nis direct paste from the book’s sources which I have not yet written in my own words or added anything to. Stay tuned.\nAlternatively, we can compute the residuals from a linear regression fit using the residuals() function. The function rstudent() will return the studentized residuals, and we can use this function to plot the residuals against the fitted values.\n\n\n\nOn the basis of the residual plots, there is some evidence of non-linearity. Leverage statistics can be computed for any number of predictors using the hatvalues() function.\n\n\n375 \n375 \n\nThe which.max() function identifies the index of the largest element of a vector. In this case, it tells us which observation has the largest leverage statistic.\nMultiple Linear Regression\nIn order to fit a multiple linear regression model using least squares, we again use the lm() function. The syntax lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3) is used to fit a model with three predictors, x1, x2, and x3. The summary() function now outputs the regression coefficients for all the predictors.\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ lstat + age, data = Boston)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-15.981  -3.978  -1.283   1.968  23.158 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The syntax lstat:black tells R to include an interaction term between lstat and black. The syntax lstat * age simultaneously includes lstat, age, and the interaction term lstat\\(\\times\\)age as predictors; it is a shorthand for lstat + age + lstat:age.\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ lstat * age, data = Boston)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-15.806  -4.045  -1.333   2.085  27.552 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

For instance, given a predictor \\(X\\), we can create a predictor \\(X^2\\) using I(X^2). The function I() is needed since the ^ has a special meaning in a formula object; wrapping as we do allows the standard usage in R, which is to raise X to the power 2. We now perform a regression of medv onto lstat and lstat^2.\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ lstat + I(lstat^2))\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-15.2834  -3.8313  -0.5295   2.3095  25.4148 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We use the anova() function to further quantify the extent to which the quadratic fit is superior to the linear fit.\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: medv ~ lstat\nModel 2: medv ~ lstat + I(lstat^2)\n  Res.Df   RSS Df Sum of Sq     F    Pr(>F)    \n1    504 19472                                 \n2    503 15347  1    4125.1 135.2 < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nHere Model 1 represents the linear submodel containing only one predictor, lstat, while Model 2 corresponds to the larger quadratic model that has two predictors, lstat and lstat^2. The anova() function performs a hypothesis test comparing the two models. The null hypothesis is that the two models fit the data equally well, and the alternative hypothesis is that the full model is superior. Here the \\(F\\)-statistic is \\(135\\) and the associated \\(p\\)-value is virtually zero. This provides very clear evidence that the model containing the predictors lstat and lstat^2 is far superior to the model that only contains the predictor lstat. This is not surprising, since earlier we saw evidence for non-linearity in the relationship between medv and lstat. If we type\n\n\n\nthen we see that when the lstat^2 term is included in the model, there is little discernible pattern in the residuals.\nIn order to create a cubic fit, we can include a predictor of the form I(X^3). However, this approach can start to get cumbersome for higher-order polynomials. A better approach involves using the poly() function to create the polynomial within lm(). For example, the following command produces a fifth-order polynomial fit:\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ poly(lstat, 5))\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-13.5433  -3.1039  -0.7052   2.0844  27.1153 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

However, further investigation of the data reveals that no polynomial terms beyond fifth order have significant \\(p\\)-values in a regression fit.\nBy default, the poly() function orthogonalizes the predictors: this means that the features output by this function are not simply a sequence of powers of the argument. However, a linear model applied to the output of the poly() function will have the same fitted values as a linear model applied to the raw polynomials (although the coefficient estimates, standard errors, and p-values will differ). In order to obtain the raw polynomials from the poly() function, the argument raw = TRUE must be used.\nOf course, we are in no way restricted to using polynomial transformations of the predictors. Here we try a log transformation.\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ log(rm), data = Boston)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-19.487  -2.875  -0.104   2.837  39.816 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It can be used to predict values for \\(Y\\) based on its parameters, or inputs. Linear and logistic regression are parametric.\n\nnon-parametric methods (23)\nmethods that do not attempt to estimate \\(f\\). More flexible and have the potential to very closely match observations, but with the risk of overfitting the data and increasing the variance of subsequent observations. They require much more data than parametric models, and may be difficult to interpret, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines are non-parametric.\n\nprediction (26)\nseeking to guess the value of an response variable \\(y_i\\) given a set of observations and a predictor \\(f\\).\n\ninference (26)\na model that seems to better understand the relationship between the response and the predictors.\n\nsupervised learning (26)\na category of model that allows us to guess a \\(y_i\\) response to a set of predictor measurements \\(x_i, i = 1, \\dots, n\\).\n\nunsupervised learning (26)\na category of model in which there are observations/measurements \\(x_i, i = 1, \\dots, n\\), but no associated response \\(y_i\\). Linear regression cannot be used because there is no response variable to predict.\n\ncluster analysis (27)\nin unsupervised learning, a statistical method for determining whether a set of observations can be divided into “relatively distinct groups,” looking for similarities within the groups. (Topic modeling may be an example of this.)\n\nquantitative variables (28)\nnumeric values; age, height, weight, quantity. Usually the response variable type for regression problems.\n\nqualitative variables (28)\nalso categorical: values from a discrete set. Eye color, name, yes/no. Usually the response variable type for classification problems.\n\nregression problems (28)\nproblems with quantitative response variables. Given predictors foo, bar, and baz, how big is the frob?\n\nclassification problems (28)\nproblems with qualitative response variables. Given predictors foo, bar, and baz, is the outcome likely to be a frob, a frib or a freeb?\n\nmean squared error (MSE) (29)\nthe average squared error for a set of observations: \\[MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i))^2\\] MSE is small if the predicted responses are close to the true responses, and larger as it becomes less accurate; computed from training data, and Gareth et al. suggest it should be called training MSE.\n\nvariance (34)\n“the amount by which \\(\\hat{f}\\) would change if we estimated it using a different training data set”\n\nbias (35)\n“the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model”, as in the error from the (presumed) linearity of a regression against non-linear data whose complexity it does not capture. More flexible models increase variance and decrease bias.\n\nbias-variance trade-off (36)\nThe tension in seeking the best model for the data between missing the true \\(f\\) with an overly simple (biased) model, vs. an overfitted model with too much variance from mapping too closely to test data.\n\nerror rate (37)\nIn classification, the proportion of classifications that are mistakes. \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i)\\] \\(I\\) is 1 if \\(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i\\) - if the guess for any given \\(y\\) is wrong. The error rate is the percentage of incorrect classifications. Also the training erorr rate.\n\nindicator variable (37)\n\\(I\\) in the error rate definition above; a logical variable indicating the presence or absence of a characteristic or trait (such as an accurate classification).\n\ntest error rate (37)\nlike the training error rate but applied to the test data. Uses \\(\\text{Ave}\\) instead of sum notation: \\[\\text{Ave}(I(y_0 \\neq \\hat{y}_0))\\] \\(\\hat{y}_0\\) is the predicted class label from the classifier.\n\nconditional probability (37)\nThe chance that \\(Y = j\\) given an observed \\(x_0\\), as in the Bayes classifier: \\[\\text{Pr}(Y = j|X = x_0)\\] In a two-class, yes/no classifier, we decide based on whether \\(\\text{Pr}(Y = j|X = x_0)\\) is \\(> 0.5\\), or not. Note that \\(Y\\) is the class, as in “ham”/“spam”, not a \\(y\\)-axis coordinate.\n\nBayes decision boundary (38)\na visual depiction of the line of 50% probability dividing (exactly two?) classes in a two-dimensional space\n\nBayes error rate (38)\nthe expected (average) probability of classification error over all values of X in a data set. \\[1 - E(\\underset{j}{maxPr}(Y = j|X))\\] The \\(\\underset{j}{maxPr}\\) whichever of the \\(j\\) classes has the highest probability for any given value of \\(X\\). Again, \\(Y\\) is not a y-axis coordinate of a two-dimensional space, it’s the class of the classification: “yes”/“no”, “ham”/“spam”, “infected”/“not infected”. Also: “The Bayes error rate is analogous to the irreducible error, discussed earlier.”\n\nK-nearest-neighbors (KNN) (39)\na classifier that assigns a class Y to an observation based on the population proportions of its nearest neighbors; a circular “neighborhood” on a two-dimensional plot. It looks at actual data points that have been classified, and asks what any given non-classified point would be classified as based on its nearest neighbors.\n\nChapter 3\nSynergy effect / interaction effect (60)\nwhen two or more predictors affect each other as well as the outcome; when 50k each in TV or radio ads give different results than 100k in either one\n\nSimple linear regression\nthe simplest model, predicting \\(Y\\) from a single predictor \\(X\\). \\[Y \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\\] \\(\\approx\\) = “is approximately modeled as”\n\nleast squares (61)\nthe most common measure of closeness of a regression line to its data points, the sum of squares of the distances between the points and the closest point on the line (directly above or below)\n\nresidual (61)\nthe difference between \\(y_i\\) and \\(\\hat{y}_i\\), also \\(e_i\\); the difference between the \\(i\\)th response variable and the \\(i\\)th response variable predicted by the model\n\nresidual sum of squares (RSS) (62)\nthe sum of the squared residuals for each point on the regression line \\[\\text{RSS} = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_n^2\\] Formulas for \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) are on p. 62\n\nintercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) (63)\nthe expected value of \\(Y\\) when \\(X = 0\\)\n\nslope (\\(\\beta_1\\)) (63)\nthe average increase in \\(Y\\) associated with a one-unit increase in \\(X\\)\n\nerror term (\\(\\epsilon\\)) (63)\nwhatever we missed with the model, due to the true model not being linear (it almost never is), measurement error, or other variables that cause variation in \\(Y\\)\n\npopulation regression line (63)\n“the best linear approximation to the true relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)” \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\epsilon\\] least squares line (63)\n\nthe regression line made of the least-squares estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\)\n\nbias (65)\nin an estimator, something that systematically misses the true parameter; for an unbiased estimator, \\(\\hat{\\mu} = \\mu\\) when averaged over (huge) numbers of observations\n\nstandard error (SE) (65)\nthe average amount that an estimate \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) (sample mean) differs from the actual value of \\(\\mu\\) (population mean) \\[\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu})^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} (\\text{also} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})\\] \\(\\sigma\\) is “the standard deviation of each of the realizations \\(y_i\\) of \\(Y\\). Since \\(\\sigma^2\\) is divided by \\(n\\), the standard error shrinks as observations increase. It represents the amount we would expect means of additional samples to”jump around\" simply due to random chance and the limitations of the model’s accuracy.1\n\nresidual standard error (RSE) (66)\nthe estimate of \\(\\sigma\\) \\[\\text{RSE} = \\sqrt{RSS / (n-2)}\\]\n\nconfidence interval (66)\na range of values within which we have a measured probability (often 95%) of containing the true value of the parameter; a 95% confidence interval in linear regression takes the form \\[\\hat{\\beta_1} \\pm 2 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\]\n\nt-statistic (67)\nthe number of standard deviations that \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) is away from \\(0\\). \\[t = \\frac{{\\hat{\\beta_1}} - 0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})}\\] For there to be a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) has to be nonzero (i.e. have a slope). The standard error (SE) of \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) (in the denominator above) measures its accuracy; if it is small, then \\(t\\) will be larger, and if it is large, then \\(t\\) will be smaller. \\(t\\) is around 2 for a p-value of 0.05 (actually about 1.96, as 2 standard deviations is 95.45% of a normal distribution), and around 2.75 for a p-value of 0.01.\n\np-value (67)\nthe probability of observing a value greater than \\(|t|\\) by chance.\n\nmodel sum of squares (MSS) (biostats)\nAlso sometimes ESS, “explained sum of squares”: the total variance in the response \\(Y\\) that can be accounted for by the model \\[\\text{MSS} = \\sum(\\hat{y_i} - \\bar{y})^2\\]\n\nresidual sum of squares (RSS) (biostats)\nthe total variance in the response \\(Y\\) that cannot be accounted for by the model \\[\\text{RSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\\] also \\[\\text{RSS} = e_i^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_n^2\\] or \\[\\text{RSS} = (y_1 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - {\\hat{\\beta_1}x_1})^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - {\\hat{\\beta_1}x_2})^ + \\dots + (y_n - \\hat{\\beta_0} - {\\hat{\\beta_1}x_n})^2\\]\n\ntotal sum of squares (TSS) (70)\nthe total variance in the response \\(Y\\); the total variability of the response about its mean \\[\\text{TSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\] compare with RSS, the amount of variability left unexplained after the regression.
