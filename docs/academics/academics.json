Networks can have few or many actors, and one or more kinds of relations between pairs of actors.\n– (Hanneman, Robert A. and Riddle, Mark 2005, chap. 2)\n\nWeek 1\nClass lecture 1a: Nodes, Edges and Network Samples\n(Note: some terms overlap somewhat or have context-dependent synonyms.)\nnode / vertex\na junction in a network where two or more lines (edges) intersect; a dot connecting lines.\n\ntie / edge / link / relation\nlines connecting nodes, which indicate some sort of connection or relationship.\n\nnode / ego / actor\n\\(i\\) - the node being discussed or focused on; also note “Actors are described by their relations, not by their attributes.”1\n\nalter\n\\(j\\) - the node that \\(i\\) connects to\n\nnetwork population\n\\(n\\) - the size of the population or count of nodes\n\nWith set notation, we define \\(i\\) as a set of \\(n\\) elements: \\[i \\in 1, 2, 3 \\dots n\\]\nand \\(j\\) similarly as a set of \\(n\\) elements, except that \\(j\\) cannot equal \\(i\\) (a node cannot connect to itself): \\[j \\in 1, 2, 3 \\dots n, i \\ne j\\]\ninteraction threshold\na measure to determine whether two entities have a sufficient connection to be considered to have a link between them\n\nsnowball sample\nan entity group formed by starting with “a focal actor or set of actors”2 and “rolling outwards” to its connections until all nodes or actors (in a limited set) are located, or a decision to stop is made\n\negocentric name generator\na mode of building an entity group (an egocentric network) defined by connection to a single central node; like a snowball sample that doesn’t expand past the first set of connections\n\nClass lecture 1b: Ties and Adjacency Matrices\nadjacency matrix\nan \\(n \\times n\\) matrix depicting connections between \\(n\\) nodes as 0 or 1, where 1 is a connection (or vertex/edge) and 0 is the absence of one:\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nA\n-\n0\n1\n0\nB\n0\n-\n1\n0\nC\n1\n1\n-\n0\nD\n0\n0\n0\n-\ndirected tie\na relationship where \\(W_{i,j} \\ne W_{j,i}\\), as might be used to represent a transfer of resources from one node to another; graphed with arrows\n\nsymmetric tie\na relationship where \\(W_{i,j} = W_{j,i}\\), with no direction; graphed with lines\n\nbinary tie\na tie where \\(W_{i,j}\\) is 0 or 1, as in the example above, indicating the absence or presence of a tie (also dichotomous)\n\nvalued tie\na tie where \\(W_{i,j}\\) is a value \\(v\\), indicating a weight or magnitude of the connection; may be graphed with line attributes such as weight, color, etc\n\nTies are symmetric or directed, and binary or valued.\nClass lecture 1c: Edgelists\nedgelist\na table indicating edges in a network, with at least “from” and “to” columns, and possibly additional columns for attributes or values\n\nFrom\nTo\nValue\nA\nB\n5\nA\nE\n2\nB\nA\n-1\nB\nC\n4\nB\nD\n2\nC\nA\n-4\nEdgelists are more efficient in sparse networks, as they only list actual connections rather than being a matrix of all possible connections\nHanneman, Robert A. and Riddle, Mark (2005), chapter 1 (Social network data):\nbinary measures of relations\nundirected relations, 0 or 1 for the absence or presence of a connection\n\nmultiple-category nominal measures of relations\ndirected relations with categories (like “friend, lover, business relationship, kin, or no relationship”)\n\ngrouped ordinal measures of relations\nmeasures that reflect a level of intensity or degree; often turned into binary measures by means of a threshold or cut-off\n\nfull-rank ordinal measures of relations\nan ordering from 1 to \\(n\\) of an actor’s relations (uncommon in social networks)\n\ninterval measures of relations\ncontinuous measures that express the strength of connections by comparison with others, to be able to say “this tie is twice as strong as that tie”; the “most advanced” level of measurement\n\nLazer (2011)\nhomophily\nthe idea that individuals who are similar to one another are more likely to form ties\n\nwhole network data\nrelational information about a whole set (or subset) of data, with all of the actors’ relations to each other considered\n\negocentric data\nrelational information about a set of nodes connected to one particular node and not to each other\n\ndiameter\nthe maximum degree of separation between any two nodes in the network\n\none-mode data\nties among one set (or category) of agent, such as nations in the context of trade\n\ntwo-mode data\nties between different sets (or categories) of agents, such as ties between nations and international organizations\n\nBorgatti et al. (2009)\nsociometry\n“a technique for eliciting and graphically representing individuals’ subjective feelings toward one another”\n\nstrength of weak ties (SWT) theory\nthe theory that one is likelier to hear new information from people they aren’t closely connected to in a network (c.f. homiphily)\n\ncentrality\na family of positional properties of nodes in a network\n\nFreeman’s betweenness\na type of centrality where a node is frequently along the shortest path between pairs of nodes, giving control over flow or power\n\nopportunity-based antecedents\n“the likelihood that two nodes will come into contact” - when considering the formation of ties\n\nbenefit-based antecedents\n“some kind of utility maximization or discomfort minimization that leads to tie formation”\n\nnode homogeneity\na category of node outcomes referring to the similarity of nodes\n\nperformance\na category of node outcomes referring to some good (such as strong performance)\n\n\n\n\nBorgatti, Stephen P., Ajay Mehra, Daniel J.
