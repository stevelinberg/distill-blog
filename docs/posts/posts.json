    "contents": "\nI’ve been an OmniFocus user since\nversion 1.0.\nWell, sort of. I used it a ton in version 1.0 and then eventually\nstopped. Then I used it again a ton when version 2 came out, and then\neventually stopped. It worked well when I really forced myself to use\nit, but eventually I’d run out of gas, and it always bugged me a bit\nthat I couldn’t get a handle on why. I read David Allen’s “Getting Things Done”, which it\nwas inspired by, and it all made sense, but it still just had a lot of\nfriction to keep using.\nOne of the problems, I now realize, was the notion of\ncontexts - each to-do item could be assigned to one, and\nonly one, context, like “online” or “supermarket” or “home”,\ndescribing the setting where a task could be done. The problem was that\nthere were many tasks that could be done in multiple contexts, but no\nway to mark them as such. One user I talked with on one of the forums\nexplained that the way to think about it was that I myself could be in\nmultiple simultaneous contexts, like “home” and “online”, and that tasks\nthat matched either of those would appear. It sort of made sense, but it\nstill never felt natural and I eventually dropped it again.\nI checked it out again in version 3, and the problem has been solved:\ncontexts are gone, replaced by the much more versatile and familiar\nconcept of tags. Tags can be freely defined, and any item can\nhave as many tags as you want. So now I’m using it again and finding it\nmuch easier to get along with.\n(I also really appreciate that there is the option to just pay for it\nstraight up, though they also offer the odious subscription-based\npricing that everybody except developers hates. There is upgrade pricing\nfrom prior versions that makes it more affordable. They also offer educational\npricing, so between my educational pricing and upgrade discount, OF3\nwent from $99 to about $38. Sold.)\nIt’s full of really nice little interface touches that are almost\ninvisible but that make life very pleasant. One of them is the ability\nto import tasks in TaskPaper\nformat, which is very straightforward. I needed to add a list of 24\nassignments (sigh) to my inbox, one per day for the next 24 days. I had\nthem typed out, and with the help of a few emacs\nmacros added due dates and tags, using the following format:\n- task description @tags(tag1, tag2) @due(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)\nSo my full list was:\n- (ch 3) Simple linear regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-02 23:59)\n- (ch 3) Multiple linear regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-03 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Logistic regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-04 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Multiple logistic regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-05 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Linear discriminant analysis @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-06 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Quadratic discriminant analysis @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-07 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Naive Bayes @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-08 23:59)\n- (ch 4) K-Nearest Neighbors @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-09 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Poisson regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-10 23:59)\n- (ch 5) Cross-validation @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-11 23:59)\n- (ch 5) Bootstrap @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-12 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Best subset selection @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-13 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Stepwise selection @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-14 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Ridge regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-15 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Lasso @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-16 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Principal component regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-17 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Bagging @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-18 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Random forests @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-19 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Boosting @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-20 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Bayesian Additive Regression Trees @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-21 23:59)\n- (ch 9) Support Vector Machines @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-22 23:59)\n- (ch 12) Principal component analysis @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-23 23:59)\n- (ch 12) K-means clustering @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-24 23:59)\n- (ch 12) Hierarchical clustering @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-25 23:59)\nCopy the entire list, and then just paste into the inbox, and\nvoilà:\nInboxNow the problem is I have to actually do all of those\nthings.

    "contents": "\nThe gloves come off in in “Chartjunk”, chapter 5 of Edward Tufte’s “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information”. Here I am, innocently beginning to think about a poster presentation I have coming up in a couple of months and to imagine design elements that will beautify the project and help make the information easier to understand, and then right in the first paragraph, Tufte drops this:\n\nGraphical decoration, which propers in technical publications as well as in commercial and media graphics, comes cheaper than the hard work required to produce intriguing numbers and secure evidence.\n\n…ouch.\nOK, let’s not overreact: he’s not saying “don’t strive for beauty” here. The main point is that visual clutter in charts and graphs, which can take many forms, at best pollutes the message and obfuscates the data, and at worst might be used to (attempt to) conceal a lack of data. That’s fair. He then goes on to show many examples of charts rendered almost unintelligible by over-use of fill patterns, made simple by modern computer-generated graphing systems, pointless use of three-dimensional effects that don’t represent data, and heavy gridlines that visually compete with data points.\nOn the subject of graph paper, he doesn’t hold back:\n\nMost ready-made graph paper comes with a darkly printed grid. The reverse (unprinted) side should be used, for then the lines show through faintly and do not clutter the data. If the paper is heavily gridded on both sides, throw it out.\n\nA little further on, he shows this monstrosity:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure from The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, p. 118\n\n\n\n…introduced by this utter decimation:\n\nA series of weird three-dimensional displays appearing in the magazine American Education in the 1970s delighted connoisseurs of the graphically preposterous. Here five colors report, almost by happenstance, only five pieces of data (since the division within each year adds to 100 percent). This may well be the worst graphic ever to find its way into print.\n\nOn first read, I thought to myself: “I want to be a connoisseur of the graphically preposterous”. Then I thought it over a bit more and decided I wasn’t so sure.\nIn any event, I’m around the 2/3 point now in VDQI, enjoying many savagely entertaining examples of what not to do in the visual presentation of data. There are a few good examples scattered in as well, though with much lower overall frequency so far. Studying the wreckage of bad design can absolutely be educational, but with all due deference to the important work of learning from the mistakes of others, it is always easier to critique than to create. I am not “peeking ahead” out of sequence to see if he does this more in subsequent chapters; Saturday Mornings with Tufte™ are deliberately slow and meditative, with a cup of coffee and no electronic devices or distractions. So far this has been an informative and educational read, and I’m looking forward to the rest of it and then to moving on to “Beautiful Evidence”. But I’m still planning to try to create something beautiful in my upcoming poster, and hopefully I can find a way to do that that would also dodge the well-deserved barbs aimed at the many failed efforts shown in this book.\n(Endnote: I am a big fan of graph paper, and although most of my note-taking these days is on the ipad, I still have a big physical stash of my favorite, whitelines (non-referral link):\nFrom one of my whitelines notebooksIt uses a light gray tone with white gridlines instead of black, much easier on the eyes.)\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOne of the good early tidbits from Edward Tufte’s “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” is this quote from Scottish political economist William Playfair’s 1786 book “The Commercial and Political Atlas”:\n\nInformation, that is imperfectly acquired, is generally as imperfectly retained; and a man who has carefully investigated a printed table, finds, when done, that he has only a very faint and partial idea of what he has read; and that like a figure imprinted on sand, is soon totally erased and defaced.\n\nThis speaks to the general principle, widely accepted now but less so at that time, that tables of data can be hard to interpret and understand, and that knowledge gained from them is fleeting. Deep truths revealed by diligent statistical analysis are of limited value if they can’t make themselves readily understood, and if they don’t stick in the minds of viewers.\nOne of the great recent triumphs of visual design was the justly-famous “Flatten the Curve” graphic that illustrated the need to keep the rates of COVID-19 transmission low enough that hospitals could keep up and not be overwhelmed. It actually originated from the CDC in a 2007 publication with a title only a career bureaucrat could love: “Interim Pre-Pandemic Planning Guidance : Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States : Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) 2007):\nThe CDC’s original “Flatten the Curve” graphic (2007)Ponderous as the document’s title may be, this graphic nonetheless showed this nontrivial concept very well. The solid-colored curve was the bad scenario of an outbreak of a pandemic with no intervention, and the transparent curve was a view of squishing that outbreak down over time so that it would be more manageable.\nAs brilliant as the design was - far, far more effective than paragraphs of explanatory text with supporting tables of data - it was still a bit text-heavy, with two text axes and five chunks of (small) inline text that had to be read to fully understand its meaning, and similarly-colored curves showing the two different outcomes, so it wasn’t quite a glance-level chart that could be instantly understood. When COVID-19 hit in 2019, this graphic was popularized and went through many iterations of further simplification, to make its message as clear and impactful as possible. The New York Times published this version in 2020 (Roberts 2020):\nThe NYT’s simplified graphic (2020)This is even more effective: the text and colors are bold and easy to read, the axis text is simplified, there are only three elements of text in the graph (each only three words), and a third item has been added: a horizontal line indicating the healthcare system’s capacity. This is about as simple and direct as it’s possible to make this information. It communicated a complex problem in a way that could be instantly understood, by almost anyone, regardless of education levels. It may have saved millions of lives, by being shared around the world and absorbed into the collective human understanding of what needed to happen to make the pandemic as manageable as possible.\n(Another very subtle and effective change was the rendering of both curves as slightly irregular in shape, as opposed to the mathematically perfect normal-distribution forms in the CDC’s original graphic; this would help to reinforce the notion that infection / hospitalization / death rates from the pandemic would not follow shapes that could be precisely predicted, though overall trends could still be forecast.)\nNot every complex social phenomenon can be rendered into such an effective message, but good data science should always strive for this level of simplicity and clarity when the purpose is to communicate something important as broadly and effectively as possible.\n\n\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.). 2007. “Interim Pre-Pandemic Planning Guidance : Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States : Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions.” https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425.\n\n\nRoberts, Siobhan. 2020. “Flattening the Coronavirus Curve.” The New York Times, March. https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html.\n\n\n\n\n",

Data science is hard, and it’s not enough to just have a wealth of formulas and statistical techniques committed to memory: data investigation requires instincts, which can only come as the hard-won results of a great deal of study, practice and inquiry.\nAs the world re-aligns itself around the tsunami of data that is already hitting us, though, we all know that quant-fu is only half the battle. Being able to manipulate and interpret data fluently is absolutely essential, but no less so is the ability to present and communicate it effectively. Data presentation skills are meaningless (and dangerous) if built atop a weak quantitative foundation, but all the quantitative skills in the world won’t save us if we can’t make the results of our work understandable.\nSaturday readingI’m taking a few hours every Saturday morning to read Edward Tufte’s “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” and “Beautiful Evidence”. I’m not far enough in yet to articulate his vision or integrate his concepts into my own work, but it has the feeling of a correct path that I’ve learned to recognize from early forays in other fields. A lot of it is about decluttering, stripping away what is superfluous to leave only what is essential, which is one aspect of great art.\nSample page on time seriesOne of the things that I love about data science is that this principle is equally critical in both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the field. Statistical and engineering skills help strip away unneeded or irrelevant data; information design skills help visually focus on the most important aspects of what remains, to deliver the message as clearly as possible.\n(And, right out of the gate on page 1 of VDQI, as the cool kids call it, is an idea for a short quantitative project that I’ll take up in the next post.)\nVDQI p1\n\n\n",
